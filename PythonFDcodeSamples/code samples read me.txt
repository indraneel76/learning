About the Example Code

Each code listing in the book appears in its own file. Other examples
are grouped by chapter. The examples don't include code presented in
interactive mode.

To run example code, follow these steps:

1. Copy and paste the code you want to run into a new text file. Give
the file a name ending in .py - this turns it into a Python script file.

2. Do one of the following:

(a) Open the script in IDLE.

(b) Open your terminal window, change to the directory that your script
is in, type "python" at the prompt, and follow it with the name of your
script, like so:

% python file_name.py

If you want Python to go into interactive mode after you run the script,
use the -i flag when you start Python, like this:

% python -i file_name.py
